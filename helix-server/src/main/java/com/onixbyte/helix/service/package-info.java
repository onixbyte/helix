/**
 * Business service layer containing application logic and orchestration for the Helix application.
 * <p>
 * This package contains service classes that implement the core business logic and coordinate
 * between different layers of the application. Services act as the primary entry point for business
 * operations and encapsulate complex workflows, transaction management, and cross-cutting concerns.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Service Layer Architecture:</strong> The Helix application follows a layered architecture
 * where the service layer sits between the presentation layer (controllers) and the data access
 * layer (repositories). This separation ensures clean separation of concerns and promotes
 * maintainability and testability.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Intended Contents:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Domain Services:</strong> Core business logic implementations for specific domain areas
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Application Services:</strong> Orchestration services that coordinate multiple
 *   domain services
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Integration Services:</strong> Services that handle external system integrations and
 *   API communications
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Utility Services:</strong> Common utility and helper services used across
 *   the application
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Event Services:</strong> Services that handle domain events and asynchronous processing
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Service Design Principles:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Single Responsibility:</strong> Each service should have a single,
 *   well-defined responsibility
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Transaction Management:</strong> Services are responsible for defining transaction
 *   boundaries using {@code @Transactional}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Services should handle exceptions gracefully and translate
 *   them to appropriate business exceptions
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Validation:</strong> Input validation should be performed at the service layer using
 *   Bean Validation
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Security:</strong> Method-level security should be applied using Spring
 *   Security annotations
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Common Patterns:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Facade Pattern:</strong> Provide simplified interfaces to complex subsystems
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Strategy Pattern:</strong> Allow runtime selection of business algorithms
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Template Method:</strong> Define business process skeletons with customisable steps
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Observer Pattern:</strong> Publish domain events for loose coupling between services
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Integration Guidelines:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Repository Usage:</strong> Services should use repository interfaces rather than direct
 *   mapper access
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>DTO Conversion:</strong> Services should handle conversion between domain objects
 *   and DTOs
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Caching:</strong> Implement appropriate caching strategies using Spring
 *   Cache abstraction
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Async Processing:</strong> Use {@code @Async} for non-blocking operations
 *   where appropriate
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All services in this package are Spring-managed beans and support dependency injection, AOP, and
 * other Spring framework features.
