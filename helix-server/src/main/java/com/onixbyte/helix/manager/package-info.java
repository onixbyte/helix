/**
 * Business logic management and orchestration package for the Helix application.
 * <p>
 * This package is designed to contain manager classes that orchestrate complex business operations,
 * coordinate between multiple services, and handle cross-cutting concerns that span multiple
 * domain boundaries.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Manager Pattern:</strong> Managers in this package serve as facades or coordinators that
 * encapsulate complex business workflows, typically involving multiple services, repositories,
 * or external systems. They provide a higher-level abstraction over individual service components.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Intended Contents:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Workflow Managers:</strong> Orchestrate multi-step business processes
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Integration Managers:</strong> Coordinate interactions with external systems
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Transaction Managers:</strong> Handle complex transactional scenarios
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Cache Managers:</strong> Manage caching strategies and cache invalidation
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Event Managers:</strong> Coordinate event publishing and handling
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Design Guidelines:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Single Responsibility:</strong> Each manager should focus on a specific business domain
 *   or cross-cutting concern
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Service Coordination:</strong> Managers should delegate to services rather than
 *   implementing business logic directly
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Transaction Boundaries:</strong> Define clear transactional boundaries for
 *   complex operations
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provide comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms
 *   for complex workflows
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Managers typically sit between the controller layer and the service layer, providing a
 * coordination point for complex operations that require multiple service interactions or
 * cross-cutting concerns.
