/**
 * Constants for external host configurations and endpoints.
 * <p>
 * This utility class provides centralised definitions for external service hosts, API endpoints,
 * and third-party integration points used throughout the Helix application. It serves as a single
 * source of truth for external service configurations, promoting maintainability and consistency.
 * <p>
 * The class is designed to hold static final constants representing:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>External API base URLs</li>
 *   <li>Third-party service endpoints</li>
 *   <li>Integration service hosts</li>
 *   <li>External resource locations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class cannot be instantiated as it serves purely as a constant container.
