# Helix

Helix is a next-generation Java scaffolding framework designed to streamline and accelerate the development of robust Java applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and templates to quickly set up new projects, reducing boilerplate code and promoting best practices.

## Key Features

- **Next-Generation Scaffolding:** Built with modern development paradigms in mind, Helix offers an intuitive and efficient way to kickstart your Java projects. A core design principle is the direct utilisation of **native APIs from major frameworks**, consciously reducing the level of custom encapsulation over external libraries. This approach ensures transparency, minimises overhead, and allows developers to interact directly with the underlying technologies.
- **Flexible Architecture Support:**
  - **Monolithic Applications:** Ideal for traditional, self-contained applications, providing a solid foundation for enterprise-grade solutions.
  - **Spring Cloud Edition:** Optimised for microservices architectures, enabling rapid development of distributed systems with Spring Cloud components.
- **Multi-Version Java Compatibility:** Helix ensures broad compatibility across various Java versions, including but not limited to **Java 8** and **Java 17**, allowing developers to leverage the latest language features or maintain compatibility with existing infrastructure.

Helix empowers developers to focus on core business logic by handling the initial project setup and configuration, making it an invaluable tool for both new and experienced Java developers.
